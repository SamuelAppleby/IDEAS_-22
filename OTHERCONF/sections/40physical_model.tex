\section{KnoBAB Architecture}\label{sec:karch}
The methodology behind its design systematically follows the major architectural components of a relational database, with the only bespoke characteristics of tailoring such solution to the specific problem that we intend to solve (\S\ref{ssec:xltlf}), that is, computing either the Max-SAT for each log trace,  or the \textsc{Support} associated to each model clause, or computing the traces satisfying all of the model clauses (\textit{conjunctive query}).
