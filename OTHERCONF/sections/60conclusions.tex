\section{Conclusions and Future Works}
\textit{Summarize the abstract even more, as now you need also to summarize the outcome of the experiments. Furthermore, say what was legitimately left out, and which are the future works being scheduled for extending the present work.}

In particular:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Are all of the open questions in the introduction closed at this point? Are all the questions answered? 
	\item If something relevant is left out, is that considered for future work?
\end{itemize}

Experiments on parallelizations are omitted due to lack of space. Are implemented, but they are going to be tested in our future work.

Talk about the support of runtime traces (require much less computation than data mining - many fewer clauses, much less data (only 1 trace))

Another possible addition could be the inclusion of external data conditions that are not bound to data payloads. We currently consider target, correlation and theta conditions, but not external factors. 

Therefore, we can represent: 

\emph{`If it has started raining, and the moisture content of the soil is above 50 percent, a flood check must happen if more rain is forecast'}.  
As a Declare clause, this would formulate:

{\tiny$\mathbf{Response(RainStart \{moistureContent>50\%\}, FloodCheck\{forecast=rain\}) WHERE RainStart\{location\} = FloodCheck\{location\}}$}

What KnoBAB does not currently support, however, is the addition of an external global condition. 

Therefore a constraint such as:

\emph{`If it has started raining, and the moisture content of the soil is above 50 percent, a flood check must happen \textbf{2 days after} if more rain is forecast'}.  

Is not currently supported. The inclusion of these conditions would allow for greater expressiveness of each clause, and therefore the declarative model itself.
