\begin{itemize}
		\item What is the input and output format for all of the operators
	\item What does the sorting assumption guarantee at the operators' implementation level
	\item Discuss the data operators at the leaf level for accessing data, and how do we guarantee to preserve such representation.
	\item Describe the intuition over each operator
	\item Last but not least, state the other composed operators that you envisioned, and claim that this works on the same assumption of relational algebra operators, where most requent operators can be merged into one single one (e.g., theta join instead of selection and join).
	\item The semantics of the operator matches with the implementation (pseudocode), but there might differences on the algorithms being used for computing stuff efficiently.
